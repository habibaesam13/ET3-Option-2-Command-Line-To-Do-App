## 💻 Examples

Add a task with default category/priority:

```bash
java -cp "out/production/ET3Challenge;gson-2.10.1.jar" Main add "Buy milk"
```

Add a task with category and priority:

```bash
java -cp "out/production/ET3Challenge;gson-2.10.1.jar" Main add "Finish report" Work HIGH
```

List all tasks:

```bash
java -cp "out/production/ET3Challenge;gson-2.10.1.jar" Main list
```

Mark a task as done:

```bash
java -cp "out/production/ET3Challenge;gson-2.10.1.jar" Main done 1
```

Delete a task:

```bash
java -cp "out/production/ET3Challenge;gson-2.10.1.jar" Main delete 2
```

## 🛠 Development Notes

* Tasks are **not** sorted by priority in this version — they appear in the **order you added them**.
* Colored terminal output works in most Unix-based terminals and Windows PowerShell.
